    <p>Scones for tea parties - I haven't tried these yet but they're probably good.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Scones</h3>
        <li>350 g self-raising flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>90 g vegan butter, chilled in the fridge and cut into cubes</li>
        <li>180 g soy milk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp lemon juice</li>
        <h3>"Egg" wash</h3>
        <li>3 tbsp soy milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp maple syrup</li>
        <h3>Serving</h3>
        <li>jam, for serving</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200c (fan) and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, sieve together the self-raising flour, baking powder, fine sea salt and caster sugar. Add the cubed vegan butter and rub it into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles sandy crumbs.</li>
        <li>In a measuring jug, whisk together the soy milk, vanilla extract and lemon juice. Add to the dry ingredients and stir together until just combined. Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and sprinkle the top with a little extra flour.</li>
        <li>Pat the dough into a rough circle around 4 cm deep, then use a 5cm circular cutter to cut out as many scones as you're able. Pat the leftovers back into a 4cm rough circle and repeat until you can no longer cut out any scones - for me this process yielded 9 scones.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cut-out scones to a lined baking tray.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the "egg" wash ingredients then brush the tops of the scones using a pastry brush. Place in the oven to bake for 10 minutes or until fully risen and lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving with jam and vegan whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
